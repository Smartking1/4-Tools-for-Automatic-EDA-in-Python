# 4-Tools-for-Automatic-EDA-in-Python
EDA - The heart of any successful machine learning model.
Exploratory data analysis is a critical step in developing any great model. As we divide our data into train and test groups using an 80/20 split, allocating more data to training and less to test. Similarily, we spend more time prepping our data set and less time fitting it to models.
EDA entails identifying outliers, detecting missing values, converting categorical variables, determining the skewness of our datasets, and generally comprehending the underlying features in our datasets and how to use them in our models. This process can be quite tedious, but with the help of these four excellent tools, you can quickly gain an understanding of your data, including a summary of all columns, the number of missing values, the skewness of your dataset, and much more.
In this post we will be making use of Titanic dataset and some python libraries like pandas and numpy.
